# Drug-Adherence-Wearable
Arduino Code for a prototype wearable to help people track their medication

 - 02 - 2018 Updates 

This is a repo of code I used while at the iSchool to prototype an Arduino-based wearable to help people track their medication.
Much of the code is disparate and documentation is sparse at this point.
I'll be updating the documentation and running tests as I progress on the product development.

Currently unning a few tests to verify mapping values are correct.
